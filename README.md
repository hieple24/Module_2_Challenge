# Save Qualifying Loas as CSV File

This program determines which bank loans the user qualifies for, based on 4 factors:

-Credit Score

-Loan Size

-Debit to Income ratio

-Loan to Value ratio

The user is then allowed to save their qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

When the user runs the program, the initial prompt asks to enter the save path and name of the full list of bank loans. Once entered,the user is asked to enter numerical inputs for their: credit score, monthly debt, monthly income, desired loan amount, and home value. 

After the program decides which loans the user qualifies for, the user can choose where to save the file, and what to name it.
